# 5.5.4.4 Event A3 (Neighbour becomes offset better than SpCell)
The UE shall:
1> consider the entering condition for this event to be satisfied when condition A3-1, as specified below, is fulfilled;
1> consider the leaving condition for this event to be satisfied when condition A3-2, as specified below, is fulfilled;
1> use the SpCell for Mp, Ofp and Ocp.
NOTE 1: The cell(s) that triggers the event has reference signals indicated in the measObjectNR associated to this
event which may be different from the NR SpCell measObjectNR.
Inequality A3-1 (Entering condition)
Mn + Ofn + Ocn – Hys > Mp + Ofp + Ocp + Off
Inequality A3-2 (Leaving condition)

The variables in the formula are defined as follows:
Mn is the measurement result of the neighbouring cell, not taking into account any offsets.
Ofn is the measurement object specific offset of the reference signal of the neighbour cell (i.e. offsetMO as defined
within measObjectNR corresponding to the frequency of the neighbour cell).
Ocn is the cell specific offset of the neighbour cell (i.e. cellIndividualOffset as defined within measObjectNR
corresponding to the frequency of the neighbour cell, or cellIndividualOffset as defined within reportConfigNR),
and set to zero if not configured for the neighbour cell.
Mp is the measurement result of the SpCell, not taking into account any offsets.
Ofp is the measurement object specific offset of the SpCell (i.e. offsetMO as defined within measObjectNR
corresponding to the SpCell).

to the SpCell), and is set to zero if not configured for the SpCell.
Hys is the hysteresis parameter for this event (i.e. hysteresis as defined within reportConfigNR for this event).
Off is the offset parameter for this event (i.e. a3-Offset as defined within reportConfigNR for this event).
Mn, Mp are expressed in dBm in case of RSRP, or in dB in case of RSRQ and RS-SINR.
